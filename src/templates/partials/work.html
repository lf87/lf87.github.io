        <p>This is my most Recent Wordpress build. This entire site was based off of one desktop design, so it was a slightly new experience, as we usually have the majority of our designs provided, but it was a challenge I enjoyed. All my Wordpress sites
          are custom built themes, and are as heavily optimised as possible.</p>

        <p>A fully responsive IE8 (IE8 fully responsive too) compatible website, which uses hardware accelerated transitions for modern browsers (CSS and GSAP), gracefully falling back to alternative and supported transitions in older browsers. I tried to
          make absolute minimum comprimise with functionality, so apart from the inherent slower speed of some older browsers, the UX you get in Google Chrome is more or less compltely consistent with IE8. The site was structured in such a way that it could
          be easily integrated in to Sitefinity.</p>

        <p>A set of of multilingual landing pages, that I was able to get creative with, and utlise the power of the GSAP library. had a lot of fun with this!</p>

      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <p>Below are a couple of boilerplates that I created using Gulp and various node modules. These were built with the goal in mind to save time and reduce the pain of having to repeat montonous tasks over and over, by automating as much of it as possible.

      <h4>Gulp Barebones Boilerplate</h4>

        <p>This (in theory) can be used for all project types with a bit of gulpfile manipulation, although it's been structured in such a way that minimal changes should be required. The original intention was for usage with static HTML and Wordpress builds.
          It includes live HTML/CSS injection, image compression, minification, and lots more. It's fully documented, and maintained on a regular basis.</p>

      <h4>Gulp Email Boilerplate</h4>

        <img class="content-screenshot" src="http://placehold.it/768x300" alt="">
        <span>Creation Date: March 2017</span>
        <p>Because none of the current email boilerplates and build systems available were suitable for working with PSD to HTML email template creation, I decided to create my own. It's loosely based on the Gulp Barebones Boilerplate, but also includes a
          separate production task that runs a series of other tasks to create a production ready email template. Some of these tasks include inlining of styles, and media query injection.</p>
