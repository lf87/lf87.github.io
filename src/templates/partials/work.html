                    Wordpress sites are custom built using ACF, and are heavily optimised.</p>
                <p>For this particular build I added a sprinkle of CSS Grid (with a flexbox fallback)</p>

        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>Below are a couple of boilerplates that I created using Gulp and various node modules. These were built with the
            goal in mind to save time and reduce the pain of having to repeat montonous tasks over and over, by automating
            as much of it as possible.

                <p>This (in theory) can be used for all project types with a bit of gulpfile manipulation, although it's been structured
                    in such a way that minimal changes should be required. The original intention was for usage with static HTML
                    and Wordpress builds. It includes live HTML/CSS injection, image compression, minification, and lots more.
                    It's fully documented, and maintained on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>Because none of the current email boilerplates and build systems available were suitable for working with PSD
                    to HTML email template creation, I decided to create my own. It's loosely based on the Gulp Barebones Boilerplate,
                    but also includes a separate production task that runs a series of other tasks to create a production ready
                    email template. Some of these tasks include inlining of styles, and media query injection.</p>
